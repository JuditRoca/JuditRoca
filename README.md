- 👋 Hi, I’m @JuditRoca, data scientist.👩‍💻 🔍🚀
- 👀 I'm more than curious, I'm a tireless explorer. I am passionate about unraveling the gears behind each process and discovering the connections between variables. As Bill Gates said “I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.", I seek to improve work processes, automate and simplify them looking for the best result. 💡💬
- 🌱 I’m currently working on projects with machine learning, data prediction, SQL, python...
- 💎✨ Committed to bringing this unique blend of curiosity and precision to your team, I am ready to fuel growth and success together. 🌟🤝
- In my free time, I love watching series and movies 📺🎥, crafting furniture 🪑🛠️, decorating my home 🏡🖼️, and gardening 🌿. I'm always seeking new knowledge and learning from fellow data scientists. I never stop! 🌟🧑‍💻📚
